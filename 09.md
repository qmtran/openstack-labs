### Lab Duration: 60 minutes

### Lab Objective

The Neutron service can not be well controlled from the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. However, visually minded individuals may find it helpful to use the Horizon dashboard to to examine current network configuration as it does produce very clear illustrations of current network configuration. At the conclusion of this lab, students should feel comfortable creating and modifying network settings with Neutron at the CLI.

#### 1. Creating a virtual network and a router with OpenStack Horizon dashboard

In this section, we'll create a network for a tenant (acme_inc), so that you can compare and contrast the differences between working with the OpenStack Horizion dashboard, and the CLI commands.

1. Log into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard on the controller as `aliceanderson` // `fa5tpa55w0rd`

2. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    ![create network](https://i.imgur.com/HpU9M54.png)

3. Fill out the pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    NetworkName: acme-inc-network
    AdminState: UP
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/D5SobdW.png)


4. Fill out the next screen with the following information:

    ```
    CreateSubnet: (checked)
    SubnetName: acme-inc-network-subnet-10
    NetworkAddress: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPVersion: IPv4
    GatewayIP: 10.10.0.1
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ym9p55g.png)

 * Hit ENTER or click NEXT.

 * The last screen is "Subnet Details". All the defaults here are fine (Enable DHCP should be checked, Allocation Pools should be empty, DNS Name server should be empty, and Host Routes should be empty). Just press the "Create" button to create your new network!
	
5.  Now click the **"Create Router" button**

    > The Network Topology screen you are on should change to reflect the creation of this new network.

    ![Create Router Button](https://i.imgur.com/8EUPCc4.png)

6. Let's create a router to connect our new network acme-inc-network to the network public. Click on the **"+Create Router"** button in the upper right corner.

7. Fill out pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    RouterName: acme-inc-router
    AdminState: UP
    ExternalNetwork: public
    ```

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Nt0QYz.png)

    >The Network Topology page should now display the new router connected to the network public.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/l38YQMi.png)

8. All that is left is to connect this router to the acme-inc-network. Start by navigating to **Project > Network > Routers**

9. Click on the router named **acme-inc-router**

10. Now click on the tab labeled **"Interfaces"**

11. Finally click on the button **"+ Add Interface"** in the upper right corner.

12. Fill out the pop up box with the following information:

    ```
    Subnet: acme-inc-network: 10.10.0.0/24
    IPAddress: 10.10.0.1
    RouterName: acme-inc-router 
    RouterID: 
    ```
   
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/3H9fPii.png)

13. Finally, navigate back to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

14. The Network Topology screen should appear like the following screenshot:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IA5YvWS.png)

    > Because the user chestercopperpot is part of a different project (vault_tek), he should not be able to see the newly created network (acme_inc_network). Let's confirm this...

15. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, and log back in as `chestercopperpot` // `fa5tpa55w0rd`

16. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    > The user chestercopperpot should only see the public and private networks.

#### 2. Creating a virtual network and a router at the CLI

In this section, we'll create almost the same network for a different tenant (vault_tek), so that you can compare and contrast the differences between working with the OpenStack Horizion dashboard and the CLI commands. SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this). Once logged into the controller, issue the following commands:

1. Create a network called vault-tek-network

    `[root@controller]# source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron net-create vault-tek-network`

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZKividy.png)

2. Create a create a vault-tek-network subnet

    `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron subnet-create --name vault-tek-network-subnet-10 --gateway 10.10.0.1 vault-tek-network 10.10.0.0/24`

	>NOTE: The command listed above line wraps, so be sure to include the second line as well, or an error stating "too few arguments" will occur.

3. Create a create a vault-tek-network router 

    `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron router-create vault-tek-router`

4. Connect vault-tek-router to the public network
    
    `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron router-gateway-set vault-tek-router public`

5. Connect the vault-tek-router to vault-tek-network-subnet-10

    `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)# neutron router-interface-add vault-tek-router vault-tek-network-subnet-10`

6. Log into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as `chestercopperpot` // `fa5tpa55w0rd`

7. Navigate to **Project > Network > Network Topology**

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/b0lwOa8.png)

8. Navigate to **Project > Network > Networks**

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/zMUR30S.png)

    > Note that this network is not a shared network (see the big red arrow on the above screenshot), therefore it cannot be seen by other projects (tenants). Let's confirm this. 

9. Log out of the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, log back in as a different user (admin, aliceanderson, or bobbarker) and navigate back to ( Project > Network > Networks ). You should no longer see vault-tek-network. After you've confirmed that the network is indeed private, log back into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard as `chestercopperpot` // `fa5tpa55w0rd`.

10. Navigate to **Project > Network > Routers**

11. Click on the router instance vault-tek-router (the bright red arrow is pointing to it in the above screenshot).

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/uT02XJv.png)

12. IMPORTANT: On the screen you are currently on, look for a value called "ID". It is second down on the overview tab. Write down the first 6 or so characters. These will be helpful later.	
	
13. Spend some time checking out the information being presented here. Note that the router is connected to a Gateway (public). Finally, click on the interfaces tab (the bright red arrow is pointing to it in the above screenshot). This page displays a list of associated interfaces connected to the router. Note that this router has a fixed IP address (10.10.0.1), which connects it to the 10.10.0.0/24 network we just created.

	* You are looking at the interface on the vault-tek-router

#### 3. Launch an instance, and SSH into it (this is **WAY COOL!**)
 	
Now that we know a bit about security groups and networks, let's launch a new instance, and see if we can SSH into it! 

2. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

3. Click on the "Launch Instance" button

4. Fill out the Details tab as follows:

	```
	Availability Zone: nova
	Instance Name: vt2
	Flavor: m1.tiny
	Instance Count: 1
	Instance Boot Source: image
	Image name: cirros (12.6 MB)		<- cirros ships with OpenStack, and is an OS used to test out VMs. It is as lightweight as a Linux OS can possibly be
	```

5. Now click on the **Access & Security** tab so we can add our security group

 * Check the box **http-ssh**

 * Uncheck the box **default**
 
6. Now click on the **Networking** tab and click the **+** sign beside the **vault-tek-network**

7. Great! All that is left is to click the "Launch" button 
 
 * Wait until the machine spawns and comes up as **ACTIVE** and **Running** before going to the next step
 
8. Before we SSH to the Neutron server, type the following command to check out your new instance:

	`[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)#` `nova show vt2`
	
	* Look at the VERY bottom of the output. It should say, "vault-tek-network network" followed by an IP address. It is likely something like 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, 10.10.0.2, or 10.10.0.3. It doesn't matter what it is, just record it. We'll need it to SSH to this VM instance (vt2)
 
8. Navigate back to the CLI, time to SSH into the machine. In order to do this, we'll need to access that machine's namespace. In order to do this, we'll SSH to the neutron server. Type the following:

 `[root@controller] ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)#` `ssh root@neutron`
 
 `[root@neutron ~]#`
 
9. Fantastic. We are now in a Neutron node. If you're confused, click back to Lab 00, and check out the picture of the network. Remember that this is a dedicated node just for Neutron. Networking takes resources! Let's take a look at the namespaces the neutron node knows about. Type the following command:

 `[root@neutron ~]#` `ip netns list`
 
 * The above command is going to create some output. Look near the top of the output. We're looking for a match that begins **qrouter-**, but notice that there are many **qrouter-** entries. We want the one that is followed by the same characters you recorded back in step "2.12"

 * Once you've found this value, highlight it with your mouse
 
10. Now we're going to tell neutron to access that router's namespace, and then SSH to the VM we just created. If it works, you'll be prompted to log into the VM instance you just created (vt2)

	`[root@neutron ~]#` `ip netns exec <right_click_to_paste_the_highlighted_namspace> ssh cirros@<IP_address_of_vt2>`

	> NOTE 1: The name space should include qrouter- portion in front of the ID
	> NOTE 2: The IP_address_of_vt2 was obtained in step 7 when you issued the command "nova show vt2" on the controller.
	
	```
	The authenticity of host '10.10.0.3 (10.10.0.3)' can't be established.
	RSA key fingerprint is 26:6b:23:9c:ab:bb:eb:b5:3a:18:b5:8e:72:ba:b4:4f.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes					<- Type YES then enter
	Warning: Permanently added '10.10.0.3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
	cirros@10.10.0.3's password: cubswin:)										<- The password to all cirros images is cubswin:)
	```

11. There you go! If it worked, you'll be inside of the little VM you just started! This lab was heavy lifting, so if you don't understand something, ask the instructor.

12. There isn't much to see inside of a CirrOS VM, so once your curiosity is satisfied, type the following to return to root@controller

	`$` `exit`
	
	`[root@neutron ~]#` `exit`
	
	`[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#`
