### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud. Although you install each OpenStack service separately, the OpenStack services work together to meet your cloud needs: Identity, Compute, Image service, Block Storage, Networking (neutron), Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry. These services may be distributed or local to one another, but in all instances, after you have authenticated yourself through Identity (keystone), you use OpenStack APIs to create and admin OpenStack cloud resources.

#### 1. Servers and Nova Services

Using some basic CLI tools can help give you a sense of the shape of your OpenStack cloud; number of servers, the health of each server (Up / Down), and what services are running where.

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root 

    `[root@controller] # nova-manage service list | sort`

0. Look at the output and ask yourself the following questions... (record your answers for now, we'll discuss them at the conclusion of the lab).
 
    - How many compute servers are running?
    - Where are the compute servers running?
    - How many OpenStack cloud controllers are running?
    - What is the current state of all of your services?
     
    > A State of :-) means the service is up and running, whereas XXX means the service is no longer available. 

#### 2. Checking OpenStack Version

0. Source the `keystonerc_admin` file

    `[root@controller] # source keystonerc_admin`

    > This command will be explained in lab coming up, for right now, just know it has to do with setting proper permissions within the bash shell; a shortcut that tells the OpenStack cloud that we are the user admin. Your CLI prompt will also change

0. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone catalog | less`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # keystone-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # nova-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # glance-manage --version`
    
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)] # nova service-list`

0. Now navigate in browser to: [OpenStack Releases](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Releases)

0. Look over the chart and notice that the release date of Kilo is the same date that was being displayed each time you issued the `[$SERVICE]-manage --version command`. OpenStack is a project with ambition release dates. Take a minute to read over the notes concerning how the project is maintained.
