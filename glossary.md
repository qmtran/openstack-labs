We hope that this glossary of definitions is helpful as you study OpenStack, as well as the other topics found in this manual. Our glossary began with a fork from the OpenStack documentation. Many helpful OpenStack definitions (and documentation) are available through docs.openstack.org, or by forking the openstack/openstack-manuals repository via:

[OpenStack Manuals](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals)

- **Aardvark** - The latest addition to the OpenStack service catalog, this service provides formally verified computations on unstructured data in linear time (as a Service) through the advanced use of string-theory based, quantum wormhole colliders. Specialized hard ware is required.
- **Absolute Limit** [6] Ceiling (limits) for guest VMs. Controlled by defining total limits on RAM, number of vCPUs, and disk size.
- **Active Passive Configuration** [19] In a high-availability setup with an active/passive configuration, systems are set up to bring additional resources online to replace those that have failed.
- **Address Pool** [7] A list of the fixed and/or floating IP addresses that are allocated/assigned to a project (tenant) to be used or assigned to the VM instances in a project.
- **amypond** - The girl who waited.
- **API** [1] Application Programming Interface. A collection of specifications used to access a service, application, or program. Includes service calls, required parameters for each call, and the expected return values.
- **API Endpoint** [1] The daemon, worker, or service that a client communicates with to access an API. API endpoints can provide any number of services such as authentication, accounting information, performance metrics, compute (nova) VM instance commands, population density of European & African Swallows anything!
- **API Key** [5] A term sometimes used to describe an API token.
- **API Token** [5] Passed on API requests and used by OpenStack services to verify that this particular user is authorized to access and run the requested operation.
- **API Version** [5] The API version can be found as part of the URL.
- **Austin** [1] The first release of OpenStack was called Austin. Unsurprisingly, the first design summit took place in this capital city of Texas. OpenStack versions are short lived, and the release dates are aggressive (about 2 new releases a year). Generally, a customer will fork an OpenStack release version, and stick with it.
- **Authentication Token** [5] The identity service (Keystone) first confirms the identity of a user, process, or client; authorized because they've provided a private key, token, password, fingerprint, or similar security mechanism. The authentication token is a string of text returned to the user that is then included with a subsequent API request.
- **Back End** [1] Any processes that are obfuscated from the user. Think daemons waiting in the background waiting for requests, or carrying out tasks in response to messages in a queue; an example might be the creation and deletion of volumes on storage arrays, or passing tokens with API calls.

- **Cache Pruner** [10] Image cache has a configurable maximum size. If glance-cache-pruner is running, and the image_cache_max_size is exceeded, it will start running and try to remove images in a stalled or invalid state due to image cache writing failing to complete, or not being written properly. It is recommended that cron is used to fire off glance-cache-pruner at a regular interval.
- **Ceilometer** [14] The project name for the Telemetry service, which is an integrated project that provides metering and measuring facilities for OpenStack.
- **Ceph** [12] The OpenStack storage system of choice because it is massively scalable, and therefore well suited for big data. Ceph uses a distributed storage system that consists of an object and block store, as well as a POSIX-compatible distributed file system.
